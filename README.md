# Frontend Mini Projects 🌐

This repository contains a collection of simple frontend projects I created while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These mini projects helped me understand DOM manipulation, styling, event handling, and responsive design basics.

## 📁 Projects Included

1. **Navbar** – A responsive navigation bar with toggle functionality.
2. **Color Flipper** – Click a button to change the background color randomly.
3. **Counter** – A counter app with increment, decrement, and reset features.
4. **Grocery Bud** – Add and remove grocery items with dynamic DOM updates.
5. **Menu Filter** – Filter food menu items by category (breakfast, lunch, dinner).

Each project is inside its own folder, containing:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

## 🚀 Getting Started
